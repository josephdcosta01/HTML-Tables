# HTML-Tables


HTML table tag is used to display data in tabular form (row * column). There can be many columns in a row.

We can create a table to display data in tabular form, using <table> element, with the help of <tr> , <td>, and <th> elements.

In Each table, table row is defined by <tr> tag, table header is defined by <th>, and table data is defined by <td> tags.

HTML tables are used to manage the layout of the page e.g. header section, navigation bar, body content, footer section etc. But it is recommended to use div tag over table to manage the layout of the page .

<table>

It defines a table.
<tr>	It defines a row in a table.
<th>	It defines a header cell in a table.
<td>	It defines a cell in a table.
<caption>	It defines the table caption.
<colgroup>	It specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting.
<col>

It is used with <colgroup> element to specify column properties for each column.
<tbody>	It is used to group the body content in a table.
<thead>	It is used to group the header content in a table.
<tfooter>	It is used to group the footer content in a table.


Step 1: Firstly, we have to type the Html code in any text editor or open the existing Html file in the text editor in which we want to make a table.
Step 2: Now, place the cursor at the point between the body tag where we want to display a table on the page. And, then type the <table> tag at that point.
Step 2: Now, place the cursor at the point between the body tag where we want to display a table on the page. And, then type the <table> tag at that point.
Step 4: Now, we have to use the <th> tag which indicates the headings of the table. So, type the <th> tag in the next line.
Step 5: Now, we have to type the name of first heading which is to be inserted in the first cell of the first row. After typing, we have to close the table heading by </th> tag.
Step 6: Same as step 5, we can also insert the other table headings by using the <th> tag. When all the table headings are done, then we have to close the first row by closing the </tr> tag.
Step 7: Now, we have to create a new row for entering the values according to the name of columns. So, type the <tr> tag in the next line.
